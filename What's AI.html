<h2>Artificial intelligence:</h2>
<p>Artificial intelligence is a simulation of the human intelligence, in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.
The period between 1940 and 1960 was strongly marked by the conjunction of technological developments and the desire to understand how to bring together the functioning of machines and organic beings. For Norbert Wiener, a pioneer in cybernetics, the aim was to unify mathematical theory, electronics and automation as "a whole theory of control and communication, both in animals and machines". Just before, a first mathematical and computer model of the biological neuron had been developed by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts as early as 1943. In 1968 Stanley Kubrick directed the film "2001 Space Odyssey" where a computer - HAL 9000 summarizes in itself the whole sum of ethical questions posed by AI: will it represent a high level of sophistication, a good for humanity or a danger? The impact of the film will naturally not be scientific but it will contribute to popularize the theme, just as the science fiction author Philip K. Dick, who will never cease to wonder if, one day, the machines will experience emotions. This new technological equipment has enabled some significant public successes and has boosted funding: in 2011, Watson, IBM's IA, will win the games against 2 Jeopardy champions! Â». In 2012, Google X will be able to have an AI recognize cats on a video. More than 16,000 processors have been used for this last task, but the potential is extraordinary: a machine learns to distinguish something. Where did this miracle come from? A complete paradigm shift from expert systems. The approach has become inductive: it is no longer a question of coding rules as for expert systems, but of letting computers discover them alone by correlation and classification, on the basis of a massive amount of data.
Among machine learning techniques, deep learning seems the most promising for a number of applications . Similar results were achieved by Hinton's image recognition team.
Overnight, a large majority of research teams turned to this technology with indisputable benefits. This type of learning has also enabled considerable progress in text recognition, but, according to experts like Yann LeCun, there is still a long way to go to produce text understanding systems.
